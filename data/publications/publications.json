      "abstract": "Automated detection of small and rare wildlife in aerial imagery is crucial for effective conservation, yet remains a significant technical challenge. Prairie dogs exemplify this issue: their ecological importance as keystone species contrasts sharply with their elusive presence--marked by small size, sparse distribution, and subtle visual features--which undermines existing detection approaches. To address these challenges, we propose RareSpot, a robust detection framework integrating multi-scale consistency learning and context-aware augmentation. Our multi-scale consistency approach leverages structured alignment across feature pyramids, enhancing fine-grained object representation and mitigating scale-related feature loss. Complementarily, context-aware augmentation strategically synthesizes challenging training instances by embedding difficult-to-detect samples into realistic environmental contexts, significantly boosting model precision and recall. Evaluated on an expert-annotated prairie dog drone imagery benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving detection accuracy by over 35% compared to baseline methods. Importantly, it generalizes effectively across additional wildlife datasets, demonstrating broad applicability. The RareSpot benchmark and approach not only support critical ecological monitoring but also establish a new foundation for detecting small, rare species in complex aerial scenes.",

Existing methods show poor performance in detecting triplets outside of a predefined set, primarily due to their reliance on dependent feature learning. To address this issue we propose DDS– a decoupled dynamic scene-graph generation network- that consists of two independent branches that can disentangle extracted features. The key innovation of the current paper is the decoupling of the features representing the relationships from those of the objects, which enables the detection of novel object-relationship combinations. The DDS model is evaluated on three datasets and outperforms previous methods by a significant margin, especially in detecting previously unseen triplets.",

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.",

      "abstract": "We propose PhaseForensics, a DeepFake (DF) video detection method that uses a phase-based motion representation of facial temporal dynamics. Existing methods that rely on temporal information across video frames for DF detection have many advantages over the methods that only utilize the per-frame features. However, these temporal DF detection methods still show limited cross-dataset generalization and robustness to common distortions due to factors such as error-prone motion estimation, inaccurate landmark tracking, or the susceptibility of the pixel intensity-based features to adversarial distortions and the cross-dataset domain shifts. Our key insight to overcome these issues is to leverage the temporal phase variations in the band-pass frequency components of a face region across video frames. This not only enables a robust estimate of the temporal dynamics in the facial regions, but is also less prone to cross-dataset variations. Furthermore, we show that the band-pass filters used to compute the local per-frame phase form an effective defense against the perturbations commonly seen in gradient-based adversarial attacks. Overall, with PhaseForensics, we show improved distortion and adversarial robustness, and state-of-the-art cross-dataset generalization, with 92.4% video-level AUC on the challenging CelebDFv2 benchmark (a recent state of-the-art method, FTCN, compares at 86.9%).",

ReTrace uses a Reeb graph whose nodes and edges capture the topology of white matter fiber bundles. We evaluate the performance of 96 algorithms from the ISMRM Tractography Challenge and the standard algorithms implemented in DSI Studio for the population-averaged Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset. The existing evaluation metrics such as the f-score, bundle overlap, and bundle overreach fail to account for fiber continuity resulting in high scores even for broken fibers, branching artifacts, and mis-tracked fiber crossing. In contrast, we show that ReTrace effectively penalizes the incorrect tracking of fibers within bundles while concurrently pinpointing positions with significant deviation from the ground truth. Based on our analysis of ISMRM challenge data, we find that no single algorithm consistently outperforms others across all known white matter fiber bundles, highlighting the limitations of the current tractography methods. We also observe that deterministic tractography algorithms perform better in tracking the fundamental properties of fiber bundles, specifically merging and splitting, compared to probabilistic tractography. We compare different algorithmic approaches for a given bundle to highlight the specific characteristics that contribute to successful tracking, thus providing topological insights into the development of advanced tractography algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Tractography can generate millions of complex curvilinear fibers (streamlines) in 3D that exhibit the geometry of white matter pathways in the brain. Common approaches to analyzing white matter connectivity are based on adjacency matrices that quantify connection strength but do not account for any topological information. A critical element in neurological and developmental disorders is the topological deterioration and irregularities in streamlines. In this paper, we propose a novel Reeb graph-based method “ReeBundle” that efficiently encodes the topology and geometry of white matter fibers. Given the trajectories of neuronal fiber pathways (neuroanatomical bundle), we re-bundle the streamlines by modeling their spatial evolution to capture geometrically significant events (akin to a fingerprint). ReeBundle parameters control the granularity of the model and handle the presence of improbable streamlines commonly produced by tractography. Further, we propose a new Reeb graph-based distance metric that quantifies topological differences for automated quality control and bundle comparison. We show the practical usage of our method using two datasets: (1) For International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) dataset, ReeBundle handles the morphology of the white matter tract configurations due to branching and local ambiguities in complicated bundle tracts like anterior and posterior commissures; (2) For the longitudinal repeated measures in the Cognitive Resilience and Sleep History (CRASH) dataset, repeated scans of a given subject acquired weeks apart lead to provably similar Reeb graphs that differ significantly from other subjects, thus highlighting ReeBundle’s potential for clinical fingerprinting of brain regions.",

Two de-identified and independent datasets are studied: 45 brain CT scans (24 diagnosed with iNPH and 21 normal elderly individuals) are used to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed ventricular volume metric as a diagnostic tool for iNPH. The performance of our deep learning model-based metric is compared to the traditional Evan’s Index using ROC analysis. 16 subjects with a total of 50 longitudinal CT scans taken before and after shunt surgery across different imaging centers are studied to quantify the impact of shunt treatment. Clinical symptoms of gait, balance, cognition, and bladder continence are studied with respect to the proposed metric. Our proposed metric achieves high accuracy (0.95), precision (0.96), and recall (0.96) in distinguishing between normal and iNPH subjects, surpassing the performance of the Evan’s Index.

However, 3D object generation has not garnered the same attention or success as its predecessor. To facilitate novel progress at the intersection of computer vision and materials science, we propose a 3DMaterialGAN network that is capable of recognizing and synthesizing individual grains whose morphology conforms to a given 3D polycrystalline material microstructure. This Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture yields complex 3D objects from probabilistic latent space vectors with no additional information from 2D rendered images. We show that this method performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art on benchmark annotated 3D datasets, while also being able to distinguish and generate objects that are not easily annotated, such as grain morphologies. The value of our algorithm is demonstrated with analysis on experimental real-world data, namely generating 3D grain structures found in a commercially relevant wrought titanium alloy, which were validated through statistical shape comparison. This framework lays the foundation for the recognition and synthesis of polycrystalline material microstructures, which are used in additive manufacturing, aerospace, and structural design applications.

In this paper, we introduce a novel method to integrate location information with the state-of-the-art patch-based neural networks for brain tumor segmentation. This is motivated by the observation that lesions are not uniformly distributed across different brain parcellation regions and that a locality-sensitive segmentation is likely to obtain better segmentation accuracy. Toward this, we use an existing brain parcellation atlas in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and map this atlas to the individual subject data. This mapped atlas in the subject data space is integrated with structural Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data, and patch-based neural networks, including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic, are trained to classify the different brain lesions. Multiple state-of-the-art neural networks are trained and integrated with XGBoost fusion in the proposed two-level ensemble method. The first level reduces the uncertainty of the same type of models with different seed initializations, and the second level leverages the advantages of different types of neural network models. The proposed location information fusion method improves the segmentation performance of state-of-the-art networks including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic. Our proposed ensemble also achieves better segmentation performance compared to the state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2017 and rivals state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2018. Detailed results are provided on the public multimodal brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) benchmarks. ",

Existing methods, which process hyperspectral data to detect amorphous gases such as CH4 require manual inspection from domain experts and annotation of massive datasets. These methods do not scale well and are prone to human errors due to the plumes’ small pixel-footprint signature. The proposed Hyperspectral Mask-RCNN (H-mrcnn) uses principled statistics, signal processing, and deep neural networks to address these limitations. H-mrcnn introduces fast algorithms to analyze large-area hyper-spectral information and methods to autonomously represent and detect CH4 plumes. H-mrcnn processes information by match-filtering sliding windows of hyperspectral data across the spectral bands. This process produces information-rich features that are both effective plume representations and gas concentration analogs. The optimized matched-filtering stage processes spectral data, which is spatially sampled to train an ensemble of gas detectors. The ensemble outputs are fused to estimate a natural and accurate plume mask. Thorough evaluation demonstrates that H-mrcnn matches the manual and experience-dependent annotation process of experts by 85% (IOU). H-mrcnn scales to larger datasets, reduces the manual data processing and labeling time (×12), and produces rapid actionable information about gas plumes.",

We refer to these as Actor-Conditioned Attention Maps (ACAM), which amplify/dampen the features extracted from the entire scene. The resulting actor-conditioned features focus the model on regions that are relevant to the conditioned actor. For actor localization, we leverage pre-trained object detectors, which transfer better. The proposed model is efficient and our action detection pipeline achieves near real-time performance.

The tractographic feature is built from the stroke lesion and average connectome information from a group of normal subjects. The tractographic feature takes into account different functional regions that may be affected by the stroke, thus complementing the commonly used stroke volume features. The proposed tractographic feature is tested on a public stroke benchmark Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation 2017 and achieves higher accuracy than the stroke volume and the state-of-the-art feature on predicting the mRS grades of stroke patients.

      "abstract": "Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) is one of the few reversible forms of dementia. Due to their low cost and versatility, Computed Tomography (CT) scans have long been used as an aid to help diagnose intracerebral anomalies such as NPH. However, because CT imaging presents 2-dimensional slices of a 3-dimensional volume, recapitulating the ventricular space in 3-dimensions to facilitate the diagnosis of NPH poses numerous challenges such as head rotation and human error. As such, no well-defined and effective protocol currently exists for the analysis of CT scan-based ventricular, white matter and subarachnoid space volumes in the setting of NPH. The Evan's ratio, an approximation of the ratio of ventricle to brain volume using only one 2D slice of the scan, has been proposed but is not robust. Instead of manually measuring a 2-dimensional proxy for the ratio of ventricle volume to brain volume, this study proposes an automated method of calculating the brain volumes for better recognition of NPH from a radiological standpoint. The method first aligns the subject CT volume to a common space through an affine transformation, then uses a random forest classifier to mask relevant tissue types. A 3D morphological segmentation method is used to partition the brain volume, which in turn is used to train machine learning methods to classify the subjects into non-NPH vs. NPH based on volumetric information.",

      "abstract": "Clinical observations indicate that during critical care at the hospitals, a patient's sleep positioning and motion have a significant effect on recovery rate. Unfortunately, there is no formal medical protocol to record, quantify, and analyze motion of patients. There are very few clinical studies that use manual analysis of sleep poses and motion recordings to support medical benefits of patient positioning and motion monitoring. Manual processes do not scale, are prone to human errors, and put strain on an already taxed healthcare workforce. This study introduces multimodal, multiview motion analysis and summarization for healthcare (MASH). MASH is an autonomous system, which addresses these issues by monitoring healthcare environments and enabling the recording and analysis of patient sleep-pose patterns. MASH uses three RGB-D cameras to monitor patients in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) room. The proposed algorithms estimate pose direction at different temporal resolutions and use keyframes to efficiently represent pose transition dynamics. MASH combines deep features computed from the data with a modified version of hidden Markov model (HMM) to flexibly model pose duration and summarize patient motion. The performance is evaluated in ideal (BC: bright and clear/occlusion-free) and natural (DO: dark and occluded) scenarios at two motion resolutions and in two environments: a mock-up and a medical ICU. The usage of deep features is evaluated and their performance compared with engineered features. Experimental results using deep features in DO scenes increase performance from 86.7% to 93.6%, while matching the classification performance of engineered features in BC scenes. The performance of MASH is compared with HMM and C3D. The overall overtime tracing and summarization error rate across all methods increased when transitioning from the mock-up to the the medical ICU data. The proposed keyframe estimation helps achieve a 78% transition classification accuracy.",

In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of Kestrel, a video analytics system that tracks the path of vehicles across a heterogeneous camera network. In Kestrel, fixed camera feeds are processed on the cloud, and mobile devices are invoked only to resolve ambiguities in vehicle tracks. Kestrel's mobile device pipeline detects objects using a deep neural network, extracts attributes using cheap visual features, and resolves path ambiguities by careful association of vehicle visual descriptors, while using several optimizations to conserve energy and reduce latency. Our evaluations show that Kestrel can achieve precision and recall comparable to a fixed camera network of the same size and topology, while reducing energy usage on mobile devices by more than an order of magnitude.",

      "abstract": "Images and video play a major role in scientific discoveries. Significant new advances in imaging science over the past two decades have resulted in new devices and technologies that are able to probe the world at nanoscales to planetary scales. These instruments generate massive amounts of multimodal imaging data. In addition to the raw imaging data, these instruments capture additional critical information—the metadata—that include the imaging context. Further, the experimental conditions are often added manually to such metadata that describe processes that are not implicit in the instrumentation metadata. Despite these technological advances in imaging sciences, resources for curation, distribution, sharing, and analysis of such data at scale are still lacking. Robust image analysis workflows have the potential to transform image-based sciences such as biology, ecology, remote sensing, materials science, and medical imaging. In this context, this chapter presents BisQue, a novel eco-system where scientific image analysis methods can be discovered, tested, verified, refined, and shared among users on a shared, cloud-based infrastructure. The vision of BisQue is to enable large-scale, data-driven scientific explorations. The following sections will discuss the core requirements of such an architecture, challenges in developing and deploying the methods, and will conclude with an application to image recognition using deep learning.",

The analysis challenges include imaging conditions such as medical isolation (where all visitors wear scrubs), poor and non-uniform illumination, or variable camera views. We propose a role representation, which combines static appearance features such as texture and color, together with a dynamic quantification of human locations and interactions that results in a semantic map. The proposed representation is easy to compute and robust to varying ICU conditions and network configurations, which make the methods suitable for low-power distributed sensor network deployment. Thorough evaluations and comparisons with competing methods are performed. The findings from this approach enable the compliant analysis of workflows in healthcare, while protecting the privacy of patients and medical staff.",

In this paper, we present a method to leverage human knowledge in the form of annotated video libraries in a novel search and retrieval based setting to track objects in unseen video sequences. For every video sequence, a document that represents motion information is generated. Documents of the unseen video are queried against the library at multiple scales to find videos with similar motion characteristics. This provides us with coarse localization of objects in the unseen video. We further adapt these retrieved object locations to the new video using an efficient warping scheme.

We also introduce a new challenging dataset with complex object appearance changes. ",

In the first method, the Radon transform of resampling features are computed on overlapping image patches. Deep learning classifiers and a Gaussian conditional random field model are then used to create a heatmap. Tampered regions are located using a Random Walker segmentation method. In the second method, resampling features computed on overlapping image patches are passed through a Long short-term memory (LSTM) based network for classification and localization.

      "abstract": "When modeling geo-spatial data, it is critical to capture spatial correlations for achieving high accuracy. Spatial Auto-Regression (SAR) is a common tool used to model such data, where the spatial contiguity matrix (W) encodes thespatial correlations. However, the efficacy of SAR is limited by two factors. First, it depends on the choice of contiguity matrix, which is typically not learnt from data, but instead, is assumed to be known apriori. Second, it assumes that the observations can be explained by linear models. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework to model geo-spatial data (specifically housing prices), to learn the spatial correlations automatically. We show that neighborhood information embedded in satellite imagery can be leveraged to achieve the desired spatial smoothing. An additional upside of our framework is the relaxation of linear assumption on the data. Specific challenges we tackle while implementing our framework include, (i) how much of the neighborhood is relevant while estimating housing prices? (ii) what is the right approach to capture multiple resolutions of satellite imagery? and (iii) what other data-sources can help improve the estimation of spatial correlations? We demonstrate a marked improvement of 57% on top of the SAR baseline through the use of features from deep neural networks for the cities of London, Birmingham and Liverpool.",

The lack of large scale object-level annotations and the relative abundance of image-level labels makes a compelling case for weak supervision in the object localization task. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks are a class of state-of-the-art methods for the related problem of object recognition. In this paper, we describe a novel object localization algorithm which uses classification networks trained on only image labels. This weakly supervised method leverages local spatial and semantic patterns captured in the convolutional layers of classification networks.

      "abstract": "Logistical and financial limitations of underwater operations are inherent in marine science, including biodiversity observation. Imagery is a promising way to address these challenges, but the diversity of organisms thwarts simple automated analysis. Recent developments in computer vision methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), are promising for automated classification and detection tasks but are typically very computationally expensive and require extensive training on large datasets. Therefore, managing and connecting distributed computation, large storage and human annotations of diverse marine datasets is crucial for effective application of these methods. BisQue is a cloud-based system for management, annotation, visualization, analysis and data mining of underwater and remote sensing imagery and associated data. Designed to hide the complexity of distributed storage, large computational clusters, diversity of data formats and inhomogeneous computational environments behind a user friendly web-based interface, BisQue is built around an idea of flexible and hierarchical annotations defined by the user. Such textual and graphical annotations can describe captured attributes and the relationships between data elements. Annotations are powerful enough to describe cells in fluorescent 4D images, fish species in underwater videos and kelp beds in aerial imagery. Presently we are developing BisQue-based analysis modules for automated identification of benthic marine organisms. Recent experiments with drop-out and CNN based classification of several thousand annotated underwater images demonstrated an overall accuracy above 70% for the 15 best performing species and above 85% for the top 5 species. Based on these promising results, we have extended bisque with a CNN-based classification system allowing continuous training on user-provided data.",

As opposed to the current methods that combine data from multiple sensors to generate a single feature, we extract features independently. We then use these features to estimate candidate labels and infer a pose. Our method uses modality trusts – each modality’s classification ability – to handle variable scene conditions and to deal with sensor malfunctions. Specifically, we exploit shape and appearance features extracted from three sensor modalities: RGB, depth, and pressure.

      "abstract": "Visual attention is a crucial indicator of the relative importance of objects in visual scenes to human viewers. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to extract objects which attract visual attention from videos. As human attention is naturally biased towards high level semantic objects in visual scenes, this information can be valuable to extract salient objects. The proposed algorithm extracts dominant visual tracks using eye tracking data from multiple subjects on a video sequence by a combination of mean-shift clustering and Hungarian algorithm. These visual tracks guide a generic object search algorithm to get candidate object locations and extents in every frame. Further, we propose a novel multiple object extraction algorithm by constructing a spatio-temporal mixed graph over object candidates. Bounding box based object extraction inference is performed using binary linear integer programming on a cost function defined over the graph. Finally, the object boundaries are refined using grabcut segmentation. The proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art video segmentation using eye tracking prior and obtains favorable object extraction over algorithms which do not utilize eye tracking data.",

Studying astrocytes, their morphological cell characteristics and their spatial relationships to the surrounding vasculature in the retina may elucidate their role in these conditions. Results: Our results show that in normal healthy retinas, the distribution of observed astrocyte cells does not follow a uniform distribution. The cells are significantly more densely packed around the blood vessels than a uniform distribution would predict. We also show that compared with the distribution of all cells, large cells are more dense in the vicinity of veins and toward the optic nerve head whereas smaller cells are often more dense in the vicinity of arteries. We hypothesize that since veinal astrocytes are known to transport toxic metabolic waste away from neurons they may be more critical than arterial astrocytes and therefore require larger cell bodies to process waste more efficiently.",

      "abstract": "This research focuses on enhancing computer vision algorithms using eye tracking and visual saliency. Recent advances in eye tracking device technology have enabled large scale collection of eye tracking data, without affecting viewer experience. As eye tracking data is biased towards high level image and video semantics, it provides a valuable prior for object detection in images and object extraction in videos. We specifically explore the following problems in the thesis: 1) eye tracking and saliency enhanced object detection, 2) eye tracking assisted object extraction in videos, and 3) role of object co-occurrence and camera focus in visual attention modeling. Since human attention is biased towards faces and text, in the first work we propose an approach to isolate face and text regions in images by analyzing eye tracking data from multiple subjects. Eye tracking data is clustered and region labels are predicted using a Markov random field model. In the second work, we study object extraction in videos using eye tracking prior. We propose an algorithm to extract dominant visual tracks in eye tracking data from multiple subjects by solving a linear assignment problem. Visual tracks localize object search and we propose a novel mixed graph association framework, inferred by binary integer linear programming.  In the final work, we address the problem of predicting where people look in images. We specifically explore the importance of scene context in the form of object co-occurrence and camera focus. The proposed model extracts low-, mid- and high-level and scene context features and uses a regression framework to predict visual attention map. In all the above cases, extensive experimental results show that the proposed methods outperform current state-of-the-art.",

Imagery is a promising way to address this challenge, but the complexity of diverse organisms thwarts simple automated analysis. We consider the problem of automated annotation of complex communities of sessile marine invertebrates and macroalgae in order to automate percent coverage estimation. We propose an efficient fusion technique amongst diverse classifiers based on the idea of 'dropout' in machine learning. We use dropout technique to weight each classifier implicitly and for each specie we optimize the region of interest (ROI) for highest accuracy. The preliminary results are promising and show 20% increase in average accuracy (over 30 species) when compared with the best base performance of Random Forest classifiers. The data set along with human 'ground truth' annotations are available to the public.",

      "abstract": "Camera network systems generate large volumes of potentially useful data, but extracting value from multiple, related videos can be a daunting task for a human reviewer. Multicamera video summarization seeks to make this task more tractable by generating a reduced set of output summary videos that concisely capture important portions of the input set. We present a system that approaches summarization at the level of detected activity motifs and shortens the input videos by compacting the representation of individual activities. Additionally, redundancy is removed across camera views by omitting from the summary activity occurrences that can be predicted by other occurrences. The system also detects anomalous events within a unified framework and can highlight them in the summary. Our contributions are a method for selecting useful parts of an activity to present to a viewer using activity motifs and a novel framework to score the importance of activity occurrences and allow transfer of importance between temporally related activities without solving the correspondence problem. We provide summarization results for a two camera network, an eleven camera network, and data from PETS 2001. We also include results from Amazon Mechanical Turk human experiments to evaluate how our visualization decisions affect task performance.",

      "abstract": "In a wide-area camera network, cameras are often placed such that their views do not overlap. Collaborative tasks such as tracking and activity analysis still require discovering the network topology including the extrinsic calibration of the cameras. This work addresses the problem of calibrating a fixed camera in a wide-area camera network in a global coordinate system so that the results can be shared across calibrations. We achieve this by using commonly available mobile devices such as smartphones. At least one mobile device takes images that overlap with a fixed camera's view and records the GPS position and 3D orientation of the device when an image is captured. These sensor measurements (including the image, GPS position, and device orientation) are fused in order to calibrate the fixed camera. This article derives a novel maximum likelihood estimation formulation for finding the most probable location and orientation of a fixed camera. This formulation is solved in a distributed manner using a consensus algorithm. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed methodology with several simulated and real-world datasets.",

Given a collection of images with partial labels, we first model the association between different feature modalities and the images labels. These associations are then propagated with a graph diffusion kernel to classify the unlabeled images. Towards this objective, a novel Fused Multimodal Bi-relational Graph representation is proposed, with multiple graphs corresponding to different feature modalities, and one graph corresponding to the image labels. Such a representation allows for effective exploitation of both feature complementariness and label correlation. This contrasts with previous work where these two factors are considered in isolation. Furthermore, we provide a solution to learn the weight for each image graph by estimating the discriminative power of the corresponding feature modality. Experimental results with our proposed method on two standard multi-label image datasets are very promising.",

The motivation is the study of small protrusions called spines which occur on the dendrite network of a neuron. The spatially varying density of spines is modelled by using relative distributions and regression trees. Spatial correlations are investigated by using counterparts of the K-function and pair correlation function, where the main problem is to compensate for the network geometry. This application illustrates the need for careful analysis of spatial variation in the intensity of points, before assessing any evidence of clustering.",
