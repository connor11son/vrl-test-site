                                vision-based systems. Over the years, VRL researchers have developed algorithms to
                                determine complex human activity in different modalities. In the past, the researchers
                                from the lab have collaborated with various organizations in creating different systems
                                and algorithms including an online system to detect atomic human activities from
                                continuous video streams, person reidentification and activity detection algorithms etc.

                                Deep Learning to accelerate Material discovery and close the gap in the
                                processing-structure-properties (PSP) relationship. Each time getting data from physical
                                experiments are time-consuming and costly. Therefore numerical simulation tools are used
                                to generate synthetic data. However, results from existing physics-based numerical
                                simulation models are not up to mark and computationally infeasible at high resolution
                                in space and time. We are designing neural network-based generative models using physics
                                to generate synthetic materials from given properties and structures.</p>
